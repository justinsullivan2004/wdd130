    <p>I am working towards a computer science degree but currently have not decided what I want to do. </p>

    <p>I enjoy playing guitar, hockey, and overall just hanging with friends. </p>

    <p>Some advantages I see is expanding my own understanding of the computer science degree and the other kinds
        of jobs out there. <br> Im taking this course to help me expand on that understanding and hope to pass this class
        with a firm understanding of these topics <br>covered in class. The way I will use this informaiton is by helping
        me decide my future job and what languages I want to work with in the future.
